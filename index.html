        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          We specialize in working with owners who are ready to transition their
          business and want to ensure their legacy and cultural values are preserved.
          Our approach is personal and thoughtful â€” rooted in deep respect for founders'
          legacy and a commitment to carrying it forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand that a business represents more than just financial value. It
          embodies years of dedication, cultural values that guide the way work gets
          done, relationships that have been carefully nurtured, and a legacy that
          deserves to be honored.
